# Protocol Update 14.12

## ⭐ Stash
With the winter update, you will be able to store all items in your inventory that are in pristine condition. This includes pieces of equipment that are not imbued or layered, as well as rings, amulets, and necklaces that still have their full duration or all of their charges remaining. However, containers and items that cannot be traded on the Market, such as partially used, imbued, or leveled items, are excluded.

To reflect this expansion, supply stash will be renamed to stash. The stash contains no slot limit on your deposit. Additionally, more filter options for item categories will be selected.

## ⭐ Tier on boots
This passive bonus amplifies the effect of the tiered items you are using, increasing their chance of activation. The higher the tier of your boots, the greater this passive bonus will be. Just like other items, the maximum number of tiers for boots is determined by your rank.

Three new subsections have been added to this area to replace the Combat Stats tab: Attack Stats, Defense Stats, and Miscellaneous Stats.
