# Protocol Update 14.12

## ⭐ Stash
With the winter update, you will be able to store all items in your inventory that are in pristine condition. This includes pieces of equipment that are not imbued or layered, as well as rings, amulets, and necklaces that still have their full duration or all of their charges remaining. However, containers and items that cannot be traded on the Market, such as partially used, imbued, or leveled items, are excluded.

To reflect this expansion, supply stash will be renamed to stash. The stash contains no slot limit on your deposit. Additionally, more filter options for item categories will be selected.

## ⭐ Tier on boots
This passive bonus amplifies the effect of the tiered items you are using, increasing their chance of activation. The higher the tier of your boots, the greater this passive bonus will be. Just like other items, the maximum number of tiers for boots is determined by your rank.

While wearing tiered boots, the activation chance displayed when inspecting your equipped tiered items will include the boots' bonus, indicated by the prefix Amplified, for example: Amplified Onslaught.

⭐ Character Stats
Combat Statistics in Cyclopedia have expanded significantly in recent years due to updates and new features, so organizing them more effectively will help improve clarity. It is now possible to obtain more detailed information about your combat statistics in the Cyclopedia, in the Character/General Stats tab. Three new subsections have been added to this area to replace the Combat Stats tab: Attack Stats, Defense Stats, and Miscellaneous Stats.

Note that Ruse, Momentum, Onslaught, Transcendence, Amplification, Drome potions, Drome potion cooldowns, Perfect Shot, Cleave, and Damage Reflection will not be displayed if their values ​​remain unchanged and are at 0. However, resistances to physical damage, earth, fire, energy, holy, ice and death will always be displayed, even if their values ​​are 0.

New subsections now provide a more detailed look at how values ​​are calculated and the factors that influence them. Additionally, new tips have been added to provide more clarity and understanding. Finally, the Skills widget has been expanded to include new Cyclopedia data, ensuring the information is easily accessible.
